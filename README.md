<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!

## Contributing

Pull requests, please! Our show notes are lovingly crafted by humans, but they're nowhere near perfect. Specific things we'd love help with:

- Fixing broken links
- Adding links to referenced URLs, projects, etc.
- Fixing typos

### Why contributing is worth your time

1. Once merged, your contribution will immediately (pending webhook execution) appear on the episode page for all to use/enjoy!
2. We routinely send thank you's on the air and on Twitter!
3. Give back to the awesome [Changelog Community](https://changelog.com/community) of hackers, podcast hosts, and guests!

## Conventions

### Directory structure and file names

Parsed and html-ized versions of these show notes live on [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com) alongside their respective episode, which is accomplished by following this naming convention:

`[podcast-slug]/[hyphenized-podcast-name]-[episode-slug].md`

For example, [the episode that lives at](https://changelog.com/rfc/13): `https://changelog.com/rfc/13`

Has [its show notes in this repo at](https://github.com/thechangelog/show-notes/blob/master/rfc/request-for-commits-13.md): `rfc/request-for-commits-13.md`

### Text formatting

Our show notes are authored good ole' [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). That means you can add `*`s or `_`s for emphasis, `[links](https://changelog.com)` to referenced people/projects, etc. We _especially_ encourage addition of links. These make the notes much more useful to readers and provide valuable SEO juice to the link-worthy things we discuss on our shows.

## Guidelines

* Frequently our show notes are prepared prior to recording
and sometimes prepared links don't make it into the show for one or another reason.
If you happen to notice one of these zombie links our policy is to remove them.

* Occasionally links for streaming content stop working because of media copyright issues.
We also want to get rid of those.
