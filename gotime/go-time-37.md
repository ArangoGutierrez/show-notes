#### What we need for Golang to really provide the best IOT/robotics development tools:

Great Bluetooth LE support

Great OpenCV support

Golang on RTOS like Zephyr, MBED

Shared set of low level hardware interfaces


#### Why Open Source?

Let’s discuss the philosophy of open source. Is the purpose of OSS just to “save money”, or perhaps there is something else to it...
