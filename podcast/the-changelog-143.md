Darcy is the creator of the Front-end Developer Interview Questions project on the H5BP org on GitHub -- it's "a list of helpful front-end related questions you can use to interview potential candidates, test yourself or completely ignore."

At the end of the episode, we turned the tables on Darcy and asked him a few questions from the list.

"The goal is to try to have the (interview) question be more open ended, and hopefully it starts a discussion between the interviewer and interviewee."  - Darcy Clarke @ 12:28

"This document is like a high school english assignment, with over 100 group members, and they all have differing opinions, and there's a ton of different subjects... It's the worst kind of open source project." - Darcy Clarke @ 22:56
