This episode is a preview of our upcoming "Future of Node.js" series recorded at Node Interactive 2016 in Austin, TX. The series is produced in partnership with Node.js Foundation and sponsored by IBM. We'll be releasing the full series soon on our new podcast "Spotlight". If you haven't subscribed to [Changelog Master](https://changelog.com/master) yet, which includes all the podcasts we produce, now would be a good time to do so. You can also subscribe to [Changelog Weekly](https://changelog.com/weekly) where we announce all the new things we're up to.
