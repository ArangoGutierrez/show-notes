First, we talk with Giovanni Caligaris about how he brought LibreOffice to the people of Paraguay by translating it to their native tongue: Guaran√≠.

Second, we talk with Stu Keroff about the Linux user group he started for kids called The Asian Penguins in a school for Asian refugees where they learn to install, use, and configure Linux and open source software.

Last, we talk with Shiya Luo about how China does Node, translations of documentation and books from English to Chinese, and the Great Firewall of China (a censorship and surveillance project of the Chinese government) which makes it very difficult for the people of China to interact with the rest of the web.
