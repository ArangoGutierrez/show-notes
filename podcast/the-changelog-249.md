Use our code `changeloghallpass` to get a FREE Expo Hall Pass to [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx). This will get you access to the hallway track, the exhibitors, and a bunch of other fun stuff.

Adam and Jerod will be there at booth 231, so make sure you stop by. We'll have some tees and stickers to give away, but they are in limited supply and reserved for members of [Changelog Community](https://changelog.com/community), which is free to join — so go sign up.
