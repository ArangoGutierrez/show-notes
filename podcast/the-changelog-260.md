Before we get to the show note links, here are some notable quotes from this episode and Oz's post.

> Software engineers go crazy for the most ridiculous things. We like to think that we’re hyper-rational, but when we have to choose a technology, we end up in a kind of frenzy —  bouncing from one person’s Hacker News comment to another’s blog post until, in a stupor, we float helplessly toward the brightest light and lay prone in front of it, oblivious to what we were looking for in the first place. This is not how rational people make decisions...

> Writing code isn't really about writing. Thinking is the thing that we do. Eventually that gets translated into running code.

> This is a counter-force against the marketing machine of high opinion technologies.

> As of 2016, Stack Exchange served 200 million requests per day, [backed by just four SQL servers](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/): a primary for Stack Overflow, a primary for everything else, and two replicas.
