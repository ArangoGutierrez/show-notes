* [gitk](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html) The git GUI repository browser
* [gitx](http://gitx.frim.nl/) Git GUI for OS X
* [gitgui](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gui.html) Unlike gitk, git gui focuses on commit generation and single file annotation and does not show project history.
* Why Git and not [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)?
* Mercurial [bookmarks](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BookmarksExtension) are references to commits that are automatically updated when new commits are made. If you do hg bookmark feature the feature bookmark refers to the current changeset.
* [hg-git](http://hg-git.github.com/) is the Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial, adding the ability to push to and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial.
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is to Hg as GitHub is to Git
* Scott says he had good intentions in [comparing Git to other version control systems](http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/) and was not lobbing stones at Mercurial
* Scott says distributed source control systems are key to helping the open source community thrive because it lets anyone commit and get involved

* GitHub has continued the libgit2 Google Summer of Code effort, supporting [Vicent Marti](http://twitter.com/#!/tanoku) to continue the development
* Scott says that Git is basically a key value store and we should look at uses beyond version control

* [Git Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) is a beautiful Git UI for the Mac
* [Showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) is a Sinatra web app that reads simple configuration files for a presentation. It is sort of like a Keynote web app engine.
