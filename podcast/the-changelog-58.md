* [Glyph Lefkowitz](http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/) is creator of Twisted.
* [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) is an event-driven networking engine written in Python.
* Twisted has its origin in the game [Divmod Imaginary](https://launchpad.net/imaginary).
* Glyph says Twisted programming is easier than programming with [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) and [eventlet](http://eventlet.net/).
* [Twisted.web](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.html) is the most popular package, but Twisted supports a wide range of other protocols in addtion to HTTP including NNTP, IMAP, SSH, IRC, FTP, and others.
* Twisted even supports [IO Completion Ports](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365198(v=vs.85).aspx) on Windows.
* Twisted’s non-blocking approach makes it great for GUI programming via GTK+, wxPython, and [more](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/choosing-reactor.html#auto10), even [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html).
* Glyph expands on his [blog post](http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/09/what-i-wish-tornado-were.html) drawing distinctions between [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) and Twisted.
* Benchmark nerds should check out [speed.twistedmatrix.com](http://speed.twistedmatrix.com/).
* [Dustin Sallings](http://dustin.github.com/2009/09/12/tornado.html) ported Tornado to Twisted’s low-level networking stack and [eliminated over 1,200 lines of code](https://github.com/dustin/tornado/commit/8c70cb013e9446713a597d792e9420523480f1fd).
* Twisted [success stories](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/SuccessStories) include LucasFilm, [HipChat](http://hipchat.com), TweetDeck, Justin.tv, and more.
* Twisted also powers [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/), used by Nasa to run its cloud.
* Glyph is proud of his [rock star sister Sara](http://www.purevolume.com/SaraLefkowitz).
* Twisted tracks [high scores](http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/) for community involvement in 8-bit beauty.
* Free [Changelog stickers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wynnxp/5514553757/) for the first person to [@reply](http://twitter.com/changelogshow) us with Glyph’s real name.
