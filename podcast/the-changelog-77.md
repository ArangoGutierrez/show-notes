*   [Ethan Schoonover](https://twitter.com/ethanschoonover) is a freelance designer, creator of Solarized.
*   [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications.
*   [Vimscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript) can be intimidating for noobs.
*   The Solarized palette aims to maximize sixteen colors, providing contrast on both dark and light backgrounds [![Solarized color scheme](http://cl.ly/2q3d2Q003O0d3B3T2v2B/solarized%20palette.png)](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
*   Ethan works in the [CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space):

> A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimension L for lightness and a and b for the color-opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly compressed CIE XYZ color space coordinates.

*   **Achievement unlocked**: First guest to mention [_fovea centralis_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis) on the show.
*   “This fellow Wright” is W. David Wright, who [experimented with color perception in 1930s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space)
*   Ethan works out of the LAB space, [mapping to other color spaces](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#the-values) as tools require.
*   Solarized looks great in a number of [fonts](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#font-samples) as well as [syntaxes](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#screenshots).
*   Wynn asks if [Sass](https://changelog.com/podcast/1) should support LAB.
*   [Terminus](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/terminus12) is Ethan’s favorite fixed with font, but also likes [Letter Gothic Mono](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/lettergothic14).
*   Wynn’s litmus test for fixed fonts is the [dashrocket alignment](http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/2011102001/coffeescript-friendly-typefaces-it-s-all-about-the-dashrocket).
*   [Micah Rich](https://twitter.com/#!/micahbrich), founder of [The League of Movable Type](http://theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) was on [Episode 0.7.4](https://changelog.com/podcast/74).
*   [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) is Ethan’s favorite Linux distro.
*   [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell.
*   The [tmux reference on the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmux) is most helpful. Check out [Episode 0.7.3](https://changelog.com/podcast/73) for more on tmux.
*   [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/) from the talented [Antonin Hildebrand](http://blog.binaryage.com/).
*   `brew tap` makes it easy to tap a new [Homebrew](https://changelog.com/podcast/35) formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps.
*   Freshmeat.net is now [freecode.com](http://freecode.com/).
*   [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) is no Photoshop replacement.
*   [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) is an advanced, purely-functional programming language.
*   [XMonad.Prompt.Input](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Prompt-Input.html) is similar to [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/).
*   [Karthik](https://twitter.com/hkarthik)’s terminal convinced Wynn to give Solarized a go.
*   Wynn [figured out](http://wynn.fm/m9) how to do ‘transparent’ colors in the tmux status bar.
*   [TaskWarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior) is Ethan’s todo manager, which is saying something since he created [Kinkless GTD](http://www.43folders.com/2007/05/31/kinkless-redux).
*   [Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com/), creator of [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/), featured on [Episode 0.5.6](https://changelog.com/podcast/56).
