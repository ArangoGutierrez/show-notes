*   [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), “the best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C projects.”
*   CocoaPods uses a [Podfile](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/A-Podfile) to specify project dependencies.
*   Eloy aspires to achieve the same level of “Twitter hate” that Bundler enjoys.
*   CocoaPods started on [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/) but now is powered by [MRI](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
*   Patches for [feature requests](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues?labels=Feature&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) are welcomed.
*   [CocoaPods specs](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) live on GitHub, similar to the [Homebrew](http://thechangelog.com/post/1122365505/episode-0-3-5-homebrew-with-max-howell) model.
*   The [Passenger pane](https://github.com/Fingertips/passengerpane) lets you configure [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) on the Mac really easily.
*   Eloy wants a [Ruby lib that shows a proper unified diff for Array, Hash, String](https://twitter.com/#!/alloy/status/187116466078879744) with color support.
*   Listener [Jonah Williams](http://twitter.com/Zalambar) asks how the community can increase adoption.
*   Objective-C is the [#10 most popular language](https://github.com/languages/Objective-C) on GitHub.
*   Eloy wrote a [file browser for MacVim](https://github.com/alloy/macvim/wiki/Screenshots) because he likes Vim but is a “gui guy.”
*   If the latest Xcode has got you down, you might try [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/index.html).
*   [BlocksKit](https://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit), the Objective-C block utilities you always wish you had.
*   [QuincyKit](http://quincykit.net/) offers crash report managment for your iOS apps.
*   [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit), a very high performance Objective-C JSON library.
*   Wynn likes [Test Flight](https://testflightapp.com/) but Eloy has switched to [Hockey App](http://www.hockeyapp.net/).
