* [Ben Klang](https://twitter.com/#!/bklang) Principal/Technology Strategist at Mojo Lingo, Project Lead for Adhearsion.
* [Ben Langfeld](https://twitter.com/#!/benlangfeld) developer at Mojo Lingo, member of Adhearsion core team.
* [Adhearsion](http://adhearsion.com/) is an open source voice application framework.
* Rails developers will find some familiarity in Adhearsion’s [controllers](http://adhearsion.com/docs/call-controllers) and [routers](http://adhearsion.com/docs/routing).
* Adhearsion [just released version 2.0](http://mojolingo.com/blog/2012/adhearsion-2-0-its-aliiiive/).
* New in 2.0, Adhearsion supports multiple backends including [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org/), [PRISM](http://voxeolabs.com/prism), [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/), and others.
* [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/) underwrites the development of Adhearsion and also provides features not available on Asterisk, such as high quality text-to-speech.
* IVR stands for [Interactive Voice Response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response).
* [Adhearsion plugins](http://adhearsion.com/docs/plugins) are simply gems that extend the Adhearsion DSL and are similar to Rails’ Railties.
* XMPP support has been [extracted into a plugin](https://github.com/adhearsion/adhearsion-xmpp).
* Adhearsion models [voice applications as MVC](http://adhearsion.com/docs/call-controllers).
* Planning is starting for the next [Adhearsion Conf](http://adhearsion.com/conference). Follow @[AdhearsionConf](https://twitter.com/#!/adhearsionconf) for details.
* You can watch the [AdhearsionConf videos](http://vimeo.com/adhearsion).
* These well done videos were done by our friends [Opus Video](http://opusvideoproductions.com/). We love their split screen presentation. Never miss the speaker or the slides.
* Video is still the frontier for telephony apps.
* Ben Langfeld loves XMPP and helps maintain the [Blather library](http://sprsquish.github.com/blather/), written by [Jeff Smick](https://twitter.com/sprsquish).
* XMPP pub-sub is hot right now, as employed by the likes of [Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com/documentation#xmpp_pubsub), the subject of [Episdode 0.3.7](http://thechangelog.com/post/1249379846/episode-0-3-7-pubsubhubbub-with-superfeedrs-julien-genes).
* [Punchblock](https://github.com/adhearsion/punchblock) “is a middleware library for telephony applications. Like Rack is to Rails and Sinatra, Punchblock provides a consistent API on top of several underlying third-party call control protocols.”
* Adhearsion uses [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/) which makes Ruby “look and smell a bit like Erlang, but without the yuckiness.”
* [_Mike_ Perham](https://twitter.com/mperham), [Tony Arcieri](https://github.com/tarcieri), and [Charles Nutter](https://twitter.com/headius) inspire Ben and Ben.
