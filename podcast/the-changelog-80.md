* Adam recently married the lovely [Heather](https://twitter.com/heatherstac).
* [Tim Caswell](http://twitter.com/creationix) is a long time friend of the show, creator of the [How to Node blog](http://howtonode.org/).
* [Lua](http://www.lua.org/about.html) is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
* [Luvit](http://luvit.io) = Lua + libUV + jIT = pure awesomesauce.
* [LuaJIT’s FFI library](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) allows calling external C functions and using C data structures from pure Lua code.
* Luvit can take advantage of most Node libraries as long as they use non-blocking IO.
* [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) is using Luvit in production already, but without HTTP.
* Tim likes the callback style of coding that V8 promotes.
* Wynn asks where Node.js is on [the Gartner hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp).
* [Luvmonkey](https://github.com/creationix/luvmonkey) is a port of libuv bindings for [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey).
* Tim fails to see the use case for [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).
* Tim worked with [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://twitter.com/#!/jashkenas) on CoffeeScript while at [Document Cloud](http://thechangelog.com/post/272530971/episode-0-0-5-document-cloud).
* [Candor](https://github.com/indutny/candor) is a language inspired by javascript, but with less features and, therefore, less complexity. So no semicolons, no exceptions and simplified anonymous function syntax (dart-like).
* Tim has played with [Go](http://lg.gd/003) but likes [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) better.
* Tim is now working at [Cloud9](http://c9.io) and their cloud-based IDE.
* Surely Tim isn’t “the only JavaScript developer within a hundred miles of” [Red Lick, TX](http://g.co/maps/reaqu).
* [Nodebits](http://nodebits.org/) is another Node.js blog.
* [Bert Belder](https://twitter.com/#!/piscisaureus) and [Ben Noordhuis](https://github.com/bnoordhuis) are the “libuv guys” at Cloud9.
* [Boot2Gecko](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/) is “an early-stage project to expose all device capabilities such that infrastructure like phone dialers can be built with Web APIs.”
