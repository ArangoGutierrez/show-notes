- [Willem de Groot recently blogged about the research he did on online skimming](https://gwillem.gitlab.io/2016/10/11/5900-online-stores-found-skimming/) â€” he published it to GitHub and they removed it without sending him a notice. Then he published it to GitLab and they did the same thing. [Then GitLab changed their mind](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/15/gitlab-reinstates-list-of-servers-that-have-malware/) and reinstated it.
